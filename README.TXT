This is my Lambda Expressions project.

To run the program go to Application and right click it and click on
"void main(String[] args)".

Here we create a simple Java program that uses a lambda expression to 
implement a functional interface (we're using the Runnable interface).

1. Define a functional interface named MathOperation with a single abstract
method operate(int a, int b).

2. Implement the Interface with Lambda Expressions.
Write a Java program that uses lambda expressions to provide implementations for
MathOperation. We implement addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.

3. A Java program that creates a list of strings and sorts it using a lambda expression.

4. A Java program that creates a list of integers and filters out even numbers using
a lambda expression.

5. A Java program that uses the Predicate functional interface to check if a string is
empty or not.

6. A Java program that uses the Function functional interface to convert a string to
upper case.

7. A Java program that composes two functions using the andThen method of the Function
interface. One function should add 1 to a number, and the other should multiply the result
by 10.

8. Define a custom functional interface named StringOperation with a method apply(String s1, String2).
Implement this interface with a lambda expression that concatenanates two strings and another that
finds the longer string.
